		                    <p>Every lesson program is centered around the students learning habits and goals.  One way a student can keep track of their progress is reviewing their own interactive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind Map</a>.  After each lesson, the teacher will add to their current mind-map to allow students to build associations and remember others when the lesson is over.</p>
		                    <p>To see an example of this, look at <a href="students/WolfgangThomann/example.html">Wolfgang Thomman's Mind Map</a>.  Our imaginary student only cares about two things; coffee and cars.  But he will learn all of the grammar structures and vocabulary he needs to succeeded in the English world through his interests!</p>

					<p>THere are many methods of teaching English out there.  I have read, studied and used many of them and can tell you that <b>there is no universal way to learn a language</b>.  Everybody is different and the wrong method for that individual will lead to ineffective learning.  I have found the best method to be a blended method of ways that work for the individual....you!</p>

                    <p>Fun and humor not only makes learning more enjoyable, but it actually allows connections made in your brain to be stronger! If you are not enjoying what you are studying, then you probably will not retain as much of it afterwards. This is the cornerstone of Pangea English.  By always communicating in English, you will learn organically through necessity by speaking about things that you feel passionate about.</p>
